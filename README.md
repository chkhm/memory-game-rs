# memory-game-rs
Implementation of a simple memory game. Cards with different symbols are randomly place in a rectangular matrix (hidden, player sees backside of the card). Players pick two cards. If the cards match, the player keeps the cards. Otherwise they go back. The player with most collected cards wins.
